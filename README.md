# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To design and develop a Library Management System (LMS) to manage books, members, and issue/return operations efficiently.

# SRS (Procedure):
Functional Requirements

Book Management: Add, update, delete, search books.

Member Management: Register, update, delete members.

Issue/Return: Issue and return books with due date and fine calculation.

Reports: View available, issued, and overdue books.

Non-Functional Requirements

Simple user interface

Quick data retrieval

Secure login for admin/librarian

Software & Hardware Requirements

Software: Java/Python, MySQL/SQLite, IDE

Hardware: 4 GB RAM, 2 GHz CPU


# Procedure

1.Create database tables: books, members, issues.

2.Develop modules for Book, Member, and Issue management.

3.Implement login authentication.

4.Test all operations (add, search, issue, return).

5.Prepare UML diagrams.
